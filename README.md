<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To use the EatsPlusPlus application, simply navigate to <a href="https://safe-plateau-43129.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow">EatsPlusPlus</a>. Once on the landing page, the user will click on the <b>burger icon</b> and be redirected to the home page. Once the user is there, the user can view the current restaurants and their ratings. The restaurants are displayed in descending order with the highest rated restaurant on the top of the list. The user can click on any of those restaurants, view the type of cuisine, the address, and all the reviews and ratings for that restaurant. The user can also add their own rating and review for the chosen restaurant. 
<br>
The user has two other options, they can do a search for a restaurant, by clicking on the <b>Search</b> icon on the top of the page. The user will type the name, click on the search icon to the right of the text field and see if the EatsPlusPlus database has a record of that restaurant. If the restaurant search doesn't produce a result, the user will see an alert notifying them,<i>no restaurant found!</i>. The user will land back on the home page where they can add the the restaurant by clicking on the <b>+</b> icon on the top of the page. From there the user will enter the name of the restaurant, the type of cuisine, and the address of the location. Once done, the user will click <b>Submit</b> and it will add their new entry in to the EatsPlusPlus database and then other users can view and add their ratings and reviews for that restaurant. Happy eating and dinning!</p>
